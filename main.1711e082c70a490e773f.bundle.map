When the\r\n\t * directive's `selector` matches\r\n\t * elements in the DOM, the following steps occur:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * 1. For each directive, the `ElementInjector` attempts to resolve the directive's constructor\r\n\t * arguments.\r\n\t * 2. Angular instantiates directives for each matched element using `ElementInjector` in a\r\n\t * depth-first order,\r\n\t *    as declared in the HTML.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ## Understanding How Injection Works\r\n\t *\r\n\t * There are three stages of injection resolution.\r\n\t * - *Pre-existing Injectors*:\r\n\t *   - The terminal {@link Injector} cannot resolve dependencies. It either throws an error or, if\r\n\t * the dependency was\r\n\t *     specified as `@Optional`, returns `null`.\r\n\t *   - The platform injector resolves browser singleton resources, such as: cookies, title,\r\n\t * location, and others.\r\n\t * - *Component Injectors*: Each component instance has its own {@link Injector}, and they follow\r\n\t * the same parent-child hierarchy\r\n\t *     as the component instances in the DOM.\r\n\t * - *Element Injectors*: Each component instance has a Shadow DOM. Within the Shadow DOM each\r\n\t * element has an `ElementInjector`\r\n\t *     which follow the same parent-child hierarchy as the DOM elements themselves.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * When a template is instantiated, it also must instantiate the corresponding directives in a\r\n\t * depth-first order. The\r\n\t * current `ElementInjector` resolves the constructor dependencies for each directive.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Angular then resolves dependencies as follows, according to the order in which they appear in the\r\n\t * {@link ViewMetadata}:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * 1. Dependencies on the current element\r\n\t * 2. Dependencies on element injectors and their parents until it encounters a Shadow DOM boundary\r\n\t * 3. Dependencies on component injectors and their parents until it encounters the root component\r\n\t * 4. Dependencies on pre-existing injectors\r\n\t *\r\n\t *\r\n\t * The `ElementInjector` can inject other directives, element-specific special objects, or it can\r\n\t * delegate to the parent\r\n\t * injector.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * To inject other directives, declare the constructor parameter as:\r\n\t * - `directive:DirectiveType`: a directive on the current element only\r\n\t * - `@Host() directive:DirectiveType`: any directive that matches the type between the current\r\n\t * element and the\r\n\t *    Shadow DOM root.\r\n\t * - `@Query(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of direct child\r\n\t * directives.\r\n\t * - `@QueryDescendants(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of any\r\n\t * child directives.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * To inject element-specific special objects, declare the constructor parameter as:\r\n\t * - `element: ElementRef` to obtain a reference to logical element in the view.\r\n\t * - `viewContainer: ViewContainerRef` to control child template instantiation, for\r\n\t * {@link DirectiveMetadata} directives only\r\n\t * - `bindingPropagation: BindingPropagation` to control change detection in a more granular way.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Example\r\n\t *\r\n\t * The following example demonstrates how dependency injection resolves constructor arguments in\r\n\t * practice.\r\n\t *\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Assume this HTML template:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * <div dependency=\"1\">\r\n\t *   <div dependency=\"2\">\r\n\t *     <div dependency=\"3\" my-directive>\r\n\t *       <div dependency=\"4\">\r\n\t *         <div dependency=\"5\"></div>\r\n\t *       </div>\r\n\t *       <div dependency=\"6\"></div>\r\n\t *     </div>\r\n\t *   </div>\r\n\t * </div>\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * With the following `dependency` decorator and `SomeService` injectable class.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Injectable()\r\n\t * class SomeService {\r\n\t * }\r\n\t *\r\n\t * @Directive({\r\n\t *   selector: '[dependency]',\r\n\t *   inputs: [\r\n\t *     'id: dependency'\r\n\t *   ]\r\n\t * })\r\n\t * class Dependency {\r\n\t *   id:string;\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Let's step through the different ways in which `MyDirective` could be declared...\r\n\t *\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### No injection\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Here the constructor is declared with no arguments, therefore nothing is injected into\r\n\t * `MyDirective`.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n\t * class MyDirective {\r\n\t *   constructor() {\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * This directive would be instantiated with no dependencies.\r\n\t *\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Component-level injection\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Directives can inject any injectable instance from the closest component injector or any of its\r\n\t * parents.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Here, the constructor declares a parameter, `someService`, and injects the `SomeService` type\r\n\t * from the parent\r\n\t * component's injector.\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n\t * class MyDirective {\r\n\t *   constructor(someService: SomeService) {\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * This directive would be instantiated with a dependency on `SomeService`.\r\n\t *\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Injecting a directive from the current element\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Directives can inject other directives declared on the current element.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n\t * class MyDirective {\r\n\t *   constructor(dependency: Dependency) {\r\n\t *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(3);\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * This directive would be instantiated with `Dependency` declared at the same element, in this case\r\n\t * `dependency=\"3\"`.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Injecting a directive from any ancestor elements\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Directives can inject other directives declared on any ancestor element (in the current Shadow\r\n\t * DOM), i.e. on the current element, the\r\n\t * parent element, or its parents.\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n\t * class MyDirective {\r\n\t *   constructor(@Host() dependency: Dependency) {\r\n\t *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(2);\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * `@Host` checks the current element, the parent, as well as its parents recursively. If\r\n\t * `dependency=\"2\"` didn't\r\n\t * exist on the direct parent, this injection would\r\n\t * have returned\r\n\t * `dependency=\"1\"`.\r\n\t *\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Injecting a live collection of direct child directives\r\n\t *\r\n\t *\r\n\t * A directive can also query for other child directives. Since parent directives are instantiated\r\n\t * before child directives, a directive can't simply inject the list of child directives. Instead,\r\n\t * the directive injects a {@link QueryList}, which updates its contents as children are added,\r\n\t * removed, or moved by a directive that uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} such as a `ngFor`, an\r\n\t * `ngIf`, or an `ngSwitch`.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n\t * class MyDirective {\r\n\t *   constructor(@Query(Dependency) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * This directive would be instantiated with a {@link QueryList} which contains `Dependency` 4 and\r\n\t * `Dependency` 6. Here, `Dependency` 5 would not be included, because it is not a direct child.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Injecting a live collection of descendant directives\r\n\t *\r\n\t * By passing the descendant flag to `@Query` above, we can include the children of the child\r\n\t * elements.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n\t * class MyDirective {\r\n\t *   constructor(@Query(Dependency, {descendants: true}) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * This directive would be instantiated with a Query which would contain `Dependency` 4, 5 and 6.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Optional injection\r\n\t *\r\n\t * The normal behavior of directives is to return an error when a specified dependency cannot be\r\n\t * resolved. If you\r\n\t * would like to inject `null` on unresolved dependency instead, you can annotate that dependency\r\n\t * with `@Optional()`.\r\n\t * This explicitly permits the author of a template to treat some of the surrounding directives as\r\n\t * optional.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n\t * class MyDirective {\r\n\t *   constructor(@Optional() dependency:Dependency) {\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * This directive would be instantiated with a `Dependency` directive found on the current element.\r\n\t * If none can be\r\n\t * found, the injector supplies `null` instead of throwing an error.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Example\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Here we use a decorator directive to simply define basic tool-tip behavior.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Directive({\r\n\t *   selector: '[tooltip]',\r\n\t *   inputs: [\r\n\t *     'text: tooltip'\r\n\t *   ],\r\n\t *   host: {\r\n\t *     '(mouseenter)': 'onMouseEnter()',\r\n\t *     '(mouseleave)': 'onMouseLeave()'\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * })\r\n\t * class Tooltip{\r\n\t *   text:string;\r\n\t *   overlay:Overlay; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\r\n\t *   overlayManager:OverlayManager; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\r\n\t *\r\n\t *   constructor(overlayManager:OverlayManager) {\r\n\t *     this.overlay = overlay;\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t *\r\n\t *   onMouseEnter() {\r\n\t *     // exact signature to be determined\r\n\t *     this.overlay = this.overlayManager.open(text, ...);\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t *\r\n\t *   onMouseLeave() {\r\n\t *     this.overlay.close();\r\n\t *     this.overlay = null;\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * In our HTML template, we can then add this behavior to a `<div>` or any other element with the\r\n\t * `tooltip` selector,\r\n\t * like so:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * <div tooltip=\"some text here\"></div>\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Directives can also control the instantiation, destruction, and positioning of inline template\r\n\t * elements:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * A directive uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} to instantiate, insert, move, and destroy views at\r\n\t * runtime.\r\n\t * The {@link ViewContainerRef} is created as a result of `<template>` element, and represents a\r\n\t * location in the current view\r\n\t * where these actions are performed.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Views are always created as children of the current {@link ViewMetadata}, and as siblings of the\r\n\t * `<template>` element. Thus a\r\n\t * directive in a child view cannot inject the directive that created it.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Since directives that create views via ViewContainers are common in Angular, and using the full\r\n\t * `<template>` element syntax is wordy, Angular\r\n\t * also supports a shorthand notation: `<li *foo=\"bar\">` and `<li template=\"foo: bar\">` are\r\n\t * equivalent.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Thus,\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * <ul>\r\n\t *   <li *foo=\"bar\" title=\"text\"></li>\r\n\t * </ul>\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Expands in use to:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * <ul>\r\n\t *   <template [foo]=\"bar\">\r\n\t *     <li title=\"text\"></li>\r\n\t *   </template>\r\n\t * </ul>\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Notice that although the shorthand places `*foo=\"bar\"` within the `<li>` element, the binding for\r\n\t * the directive\r\n\t * controller is correctly instantiated on the `<template>` element rather than the `<li>` element.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ## Lifecycle hooks\r\n\t *\r\n\t * When the directive class implements some {@link angular2/lifecycle_hooks} the callbacks are\r\n\t * called by the change detection at defined points in time during the life of the directive.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Example\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Let's suppose we want to implement the `unless` behavior, to conditionally include a template.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Here is a simple directive that triggers on an `unless` selector:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Directive({\r\n\t *   selector: '[unless]',\r\n\t *   inputs: ['unless']\r\n\t * })\r\n\t * export class Unless {\r\n\t *   viewContainer: ViewContainerRef;\r\n\t *   templateRef: TemplateRef;\r\n\t *   prevCondition: boolean;\r\n\t *\r\n\t *   constructor(viewContainer: ViewContainerRef, templateRef: TemplateRef) {\r\n\t *     this.viewContainer = viewContainer;\r\n\t *     this.templateRef = templateRef;\r\n\t *     this.prevCondition = null;\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t *\r\n\t *   set unless(newCondition) {\r\n\t *     if (newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || !this.prevCondition)) {\r\n\t *       this.prevCondition = true;\r\n\t *       this.viewContainer.clear();\r\n\t *     } else if (!newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || this.prevCondition)) {\r\n\t *       this.prevCondition = false;\r\n\t *       this.viewContainer.create(this.templateRef);\r\n\t *     }\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * We can then use this `unless` selector in a template:\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * <ul>\r\n\t *   <li *unless=\"expr\"></li>\r\n\t * </ul>\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Once the directive instantiates the child view, the shorthand notation for the template expands\r\n\t * and the result is:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * <ul>\r\n\t *   <template [unless]=\"exp\">\r\n\t *     <li></li>\r\n\t *   </template>\r\n\t *   <li></li>\r\n\t * </ul>\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Note also that although the `<li></li>` template still exists inside the `<template></template>`,\r\n\t * the instantiated\r\n\t * view occurs on the second `<li></li>` which is a sibling to the `<template>` element.\r\n\t */\r\n\tvar DirectiveMetadata = (function (_super) {\r\n\t    __extends(DirectiveMetadata, _super);\r\n\t    function DirectiveMetadata(_a) {\r\n\t        var _b = _a === void 0 ?

When the\r\n\t * directive's `selector` matches\r\n\t * elements in the DOM, the following steps occur:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * 1. For each directive, the `ElementInjector` attempts to resolve the directive's constructor\r\n\t * arguments.\r\n\t * 2. Angular instantiates directives for each matched element using `ElementInjector` in a\r\n\t * depth-first order,\r\n\t *    as declared in the HTML.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ## Understanding How Injection Works\r\n\t *\r\n\t * There are three stages of injection resolution.\r\n\t * - *Pre-existing Injectors*:\r\n\t *   - The terminal {@link Injector} cannot resolve dependencies. It either throws an error or, if\r\n\t * the dependency was\r\n\t *     specified as `@Optional`, returns `null`.\r\n\t *   - The platform injector resolves browser singleton resources, such as: cookies, title,\r\n\t * location, and others.\r\n\t * - *Component Injectors*: Each component instance has its own {@link Injector}, and they follow\r\n\t * the same parent-child hierarchy\r\n\t *     as the component instances in the DOM.\r\n\t * - *Element Injectors*: Each component instance has a Shadow DOM. Within the Shadow DOM each\r\n\t * element has an `ElementInjector`\r\n\t *     which follow the same parent-child hierarchy as the DOM elements themselves.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * When a template is instantiated, it also must instantiate the corresponding directives in a\r\n\t * depth-first order. The\r\n\t * current `ElementInjector` resolves the constructor dependencies for each directive.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Angular then resolves dependencies as follows, according to the order in which they appear in the\r\n\t * {@link ViewMetadata}:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * 1. Dependencies on the current element\r\n\t * 2. Dependencies on element injectors and their parents until it encounters a Shadow DOM boundary\r\n\t * 3. Dependencies on component injectors and their parents until it encounters the root component\r\n\t * 4. Dependencies on pre-existing injectors\r\n\t *\r\n\t *\r\n\t * The `ElementInjector` can inject other directives, element-specific special objects, or it can\r\n\t * delegate to the parent\r\n\t * injector.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * To inject other directives, declare the constructor parameter as:\r\n\t * - `directive:DirectiveType`: a directive on the current element only\r\n\t * - `@Host() directive:DirectiveType`: any directive that matches the type between the current\r\n\t * element and the\r\n\t *    Shadow DOM root.\r\n\t * - `@Query(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of direct child\r\n\t * directives.\r\n\t * - `@QueryDescendants(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of any\r\n\t * child directives.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * To inject element-specific special objects, declare the constructor parameter as:\r\n\t * - `element: ElementRef` to obtain a reference to logical element in the view.\r\n\t * - `viewContainer: ViewContainerRef` to control child template instantiation, for\r\n\t * {@link DirectiveMetadata} directives only\r\n\t * - `bindingPropagation: BindingPropagation` to control change detection in a more granular way.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Example\r\n\t *\r\n\t * The following example demonstrates how dependency injection resolves constructor arguments in\r\n\t * practice.\r\n\t *\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Assume this HTML template:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * <div dependency=\"1\">\r\n\t *   <div dependency=\"2\">\r\n\t *     <div dependency=\"3\" my-directive>\r\n\t *       <div dependency=\"4\">\r\n\t *         <div dependency=\"5\"></div>\r\n\t *       </div>\r\n\t *       <div dependency=\"6\"></div>\r\n\t *     </div>\r\n\t *   </div>\r\n\t * </div>\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * With the following `dependency` decorator and `SomeService` injectable class.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Injectable()\r\n\t * class SomeService {\r\n\t * }\r\n\t *\r\n\t * @Directive({\r\n\t *   selector: '[dependency]',\r\n\t *   inputs: [\r\n\t *     'id: dependency'\r\n\t *   ]\r\n\t * })\r\n\t * class Dependency {\r\n\t *   id:string;\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Let's step through the different ways in which `MyDirective` could be declared...\r\n\t *\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### No injection\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Here the constructor is declared with no arguments, therefore nothing is injected into\r\n\t * `MyDirective`.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n\t * class MyDirective {\r\n\t *   constructor() {\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * This directive would be instantiated with no dependencies.\r\n\t *\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Component-level injection\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Directives can inject any injectable instance from the closest component injector or any of its\r\n\t * parents.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Here, the constructor declares a parameter, `someService`, and injects the `SomeService` type\r\n\t * from the parent\r\n\t * component's injector.\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n\t * class MyDirective {\r\n\t *   constructor(someService: SomeService) {\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * This directive would be instantiated with a dependency on `SomeService`.\r\n\t *\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Injecting a directive from the current element\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Directives can inject other directives declared on the current element.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n\t * class MyDirective {\r\n\t *   constructor(dependency: Dependency) {\r\n\t *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(3);\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * This directive would be instantiated with `Dependency` declared at the same element, in this case\r\n\t * `dependency=\"3\"`.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Injecting a directive from any ancestor elements\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Directives can inject other directives declared on any ancestor element (in the current Shadow\r\n\t * DOM), i.e. on the current element, the\r\n\t * parent element, or its parents.\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n\t * class MyDirective {\r\n\t *   constructor(@Host() dependency: Dependency) {\r\n\t *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(2);\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * `@Host` checks the current element, the parent, as well as its parents recursively. If\r\n\t * `dependency=\"2\"` didn't\r\n\t * exist on the direct parent, this injection would\r\n\t * have returned\r\n\t * `dependency=\"1\"`.\r\n\t *\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Injecting a live collection of direct child directives\r\n\t *\r\n\t *\r\n\t * A directive can also query for other child directives. Since parent directives are instantiated\r\n\t * before child directives, a directive can't simply inject the list of child directives. Instead,\r\n\t * the directive injects a {@link QueryList}, which updates its contents as children are added,\r\n\t * removed, or moved by a directive that uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} such as a `ngFor`, an\r\n\t * `ngIf`, or an `ngSwitch`.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n\t * class MyDirective {\r\n\t *   constructor(@Query(Dependency) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * This directive would be instantiated with a {@link QueryList} which contains `Dependency` 4 and\r\n\t * 6. Here, `Dependency` 5 would not be included, because it is not a direct child.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Injecting a live collection of descendant directives\r\n\t *\r\n\t * By passing the descendant flag to `@Query` above, we can include the children of the child\r\n\t * elements.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n\t * class MyDirective {\r\n\t *   constructor(@Query(Dependency, {descendants: true}) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * This directive would be instantiated with a Query which would contain `Dependency` 4, 5 and 6.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Optional injection\r\n\t *\r\n\t * The normal behavior of directives is to return an error when a specified dependency cannot be\r\n\t * resolved. If you\r\n\t * would like to inject `null` on unresolved dependency instead, you can annotate that dependency\r\n\t * with `@Optional()`.\r\n\t * This explicitly permits the author of a template to treat some of the surrounding directives as\r\n\t * optional.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n\t * class MyDirective {\r\n\t *   constructor(@Optional() dependency:Dependency) {\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * This directive would be instantiated with a `Dependency` directive found on the current element.\r\n\t * If none can be\r\n\t * found, the injector supplies `null` instead of throwing an error.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Example\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Here we use a decorator directive to simply define basic tool-tip behavior.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Directive({\r\n\t *   selector: '[tooltip]',\r\n\t *   inputs: [\r\n\t *     'text: tooltip'\r\n\t *   ],\r\n\t *   host: {\r\n\t *     '(mouseenter)': 'onMouseEnter()',\r\n\t *     '(mouseleave)': 'onMouseLeave()'\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * })\r\n\t * class Tooltip{\r\n\t *   text:string;\r\n\t *   overlay:Overlay; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\r\n\t *   overlayManager:OverlayManager; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\r\n\t *\r\n\t *   constructor(overlayManager:OverlayManager) {\r\n\t *     this.overlay = overlay;\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t *\r\n\t *   onMouseEnter() {\r\n\t *     // exact signature to be determined\r\n\t *     this.overlay = this.overlayManager.open(text, ...);\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t *\r\n\t *   onMouseLeave() {\r\n\t *     this.overlay.close();\r\n\t *     this.overlay = null;\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * In our HTML template, we can then add this behavior to a `<div>` or any other element with the\r\n\t * `tooltip` selector,\r\n\t * like so:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * <div tooltip=\"some text here\"></div>\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Directives can also control the instantiation, destruction, and positioning of inline template\r\n\t * elements:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * A directive uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} to instantiate, insert, move, and destroy views at\r\n\t * runtime.\r\n\t * The {@link ViewContainerRef} is created as a result of `<template>` element, and represents a\r\n\t * location in the current view\r\n\t * where these actions are performed.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Views are always created as children of the current {@link ViewMetadata}, and as siblings of the\r\n\t * `<template>` element. Thus a\r\n\t * directive in a child view cannot inject the directive that created it.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Since directives that create views via ViewContainers are common in Angular, and using the full\r\n\t * `<template>` element syntax is wordy, Angular\r\n\t * also supports a shorthand notation: `<li *foo=\"bar\">` and `<li template=\"foo: bar\">` are\r\n\t * equivalent.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Thus,\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * <ul>\r\n\t *   <li *foo=\"bar\" title=\"text\"></li>\r\n\t * </ul>\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Expands in use to:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * <ul>\r\n\t *   <template [foo]=\"bar\">\r\n\t *     <li title=\"text\"></li>\r\n\t *   </template>\r\n\t * </ul>\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Notice that although the shorthand places `*foo=\"bar\"` within the `<li>` element, the binding for\r\n\t * the directive\r\n\t * controller is correctly instantiated on the `<template>` element rather than the `<li>` element.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ## Lifecycle hooks\r\n\t *\r\n\t * When the directive class implements some {@link angular2/lifecycle_hooks} the callbacks are\r\n\t * called by the change detection at defined points in time during the life of the directive.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Example\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Let's suppose we want to implement the `unless` behavior, to conditionally include a template.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Here is a simple directive that triggers on an `unless` selector:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * @Directive({\r\n\t *   selector: '[unless]',\r\n\t *   inputs: ['unless']\r\n\t * })\r\n\t * export class Unless {\r\n\t *   viewContainer: ViewContainerRef;\r\n\t *   templateRef: TemplateRef;\r\n\t *   prevCondition: boolean;\r\n\t *\r\n\t *   constructor(viewContainer: ViewContainerRef, templateRef: TemplateRef) {\r\n\t *     this.viewContainer = viewContainer;\r\n\t *     this.templateRef = templateRef;\r\n\t *     this.prevCondition = null;\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t *\r\n\t *   set unless(newCondition) {\r\n\t *     if (newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || !this.prevCondition)) {\r\n\t *       this.prevCondition = true;\r\n\t *       this.viewContainer.clear();\r\n\t *     } else if (!newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || this.prevCondition)) {\r\n\t *       this.prevCondition = false;\r\n\t *       this.viewContainer.create(this.templateRef);\r\n\t *     }\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * We can then use this `unless` selector in a template:\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * <ul>\r\n\t *   <li *unless=\"expr\"></li>\r\n\t * </ul>\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Once the directive instantiates the child view, the shorthand notation for the template expands\r\n\t * and the result is:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * <ul>\r\n\t *   <template [unless]=\"exp\">\r\n\t *     <li></li>\r\n\t *   </template>\r\n\t *   <li></li>\r\n\t * </ul>\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Note also that although the `<li></li>` template still exists inside the `<template></template>`,\r\n\t * the instantiated\r\n\t * view occurs on the second `<li></li>` which is a sibling to the `<template>` element.\r\n\t */\r\n\texports.Directive = decorators_1.makeDecorator(directives_2.DirectiveMetadata);\r\n\t// TODO(alexeagle): remove the duplication of this doc.

This is\r\n\t * mainly for security reasons, as well as architectural changes in Angular 2. This means\r\n\t * that `index.html` can safely be processed using server-side technologies such as\r\n\t * providers. Bindings can thus use double-curly `{{ syntax }}` without collision from\r\n\t * Angular 2 component double-curly `{{ syntax }}`.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * We can use this script code:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * {@example core/ts/bootstrap/bootstrap.ts region='bootstrap'}\r\n\t *\r\n\t * When the app developer invokes `bootstrap()` with the root component `MyApp` as its\r\n\t * argument, Angular performs the following tasks:\r\n\t *\r\n\t *  1. It uses the component's `selector` property to locate the DOM element which needs\r\n\t *     to be upgraded into the angular component.\r\n\t *  2. It creates a new child injector (from the platform injector). Optionally, you can\r\n\t *     also override the injector configuration for an app by invoking `bootstrap` with the\r\n\t *     `componentInjectableBindings` argument.\r\n\t *  3. It creates a new `Zone` and connects it to the angular application's change detection\r\n\t *     domain instance.\r\n\t *  4. It creates an emulated or shadow DOM on the selected component's host element and loads the\r\n\t *     template into it.\r\n\t *  5. It instantiates the specified component.\r\n\t *  6. Finally, Angular performs change detection to apply the initial data providers for the\r\n\t *     application.\r\n\t *\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ## Bootstrapping Multiple Applications\r\n\t *\r\n\t * When working within a browser window, there are many singleton resources: cookies, title,\r\n\t * location, and others. Angular services that represent these resources must likewise be\r\n\t * shared across all Angular applications that occupy the same browser window. For this\r\n\t * reason, Angular creates exactly one global platform object which stores all shared\r\n\t * services, and each angular application injector has the platform injector as its parent.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Each application has its own private injector as well. When there are multiple\r\n\t * applications on a page, Angular treats each application injector's services as private\r\n\t * to that application.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ## API\r\n\t *\r\n\t * - `appComponentType`: The root component which should act as the application. This is\r\n\t *   a reference to a `Type` which is annotated with `@Component(...)`.\r\n\t * - `customProviders`: An additional set of providers that can be added to the\r\n\t *   app injector to override default injection behavior.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Returns a `Promise` of {@link ComponentRef}.\r\n\t */\r\n\tfunction bootstrap(appComponentType, customProviders) {\r\n\t    core_1.reflector.reflectionCapabilities = new reflection_capabilities_1.ReflectionCapabilities();\r\n\t    var appProviders = lang_1.isPresent(customProviders) ?

The goal is to allow users to avoid the\r\n\t  most obvious pitfalls and do so without compromising performance significantly.\r\n\t  For ShadowDOM styling that's not covered here, a set of best practices\r\n\t  can be provided that should allow users to accomplish more complex styling.\r\n\t\r\n\t  The following is a list of specific ShadowDOM styling features and a brief\r\n\t  discussion of the approach used to shim.\r\n\t\r\n\t  Shimmed features:\r\n\t\r\n\t  * :host, :host-context: ShadowDOM allows styling of the shadowRoot's host\r\n\t  element using the :host rule. To shim this feature, the :host styles are\r\n\t  reformatted and prefixed with a given scope name and promoted to a\r\n\t  document level stylesheet.\r\n\t  For example, given a scope name of .foo, a rule like this:\r\n\t\r\n\t    :host {\r\n\t        background: red;\r\n\t      }\r\n\t    }\r\n\t\r\n\t  becomes:\r\n\t\r\n\t    .foo {\r\n\t      background: red;\r\n\t    }\r\n\t\r\n\t  * encapsultion: Styles defined within ShadowDOM, apply only to\r\n\t  dom inside the ShadowDOM. Polymer uses one of two techniques to implement\r\n\t  this feature.\r\n\t\r\n\t  By default, rules are prefixed with the host element tag name\r\n\t  as a descendant selector. This ensures styling does not leak out of the 'top'\r\n\t  of the element's ShadowDOM. For example,\r\n\t\r\n\t  div {\r\n\t      font-weight: bold;\r\n\t    }\r\n\t\r\n\t  becomes:\r\n\t\r\n\t  x-foo div {\r\n\t      font-weight: bold;\r\n\t    }\r\n\t\r\n\t  becomes:\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t  Alternatively, if WebComponents.ShadowCSS.strictStyling is set to true then\r\n\t  selectors are scoped by adding an attribute selector suffix to each\r\n\t  simple selector that contains the host element tag name. Each element\r\n\t  in the element's ShadowDOM template is also given the scope attribute.\r\n\t  Thus, these rules match only elements that have the scope attribute.\r\n\t  For example, given a scope name of x-foo, a rule like this:\r\n\t\r\n\t    div {\r\n\t      font-weight: bold;\r\n\t    }\r\n\t\r\n\t  becomes:\r\n\t\r\n\t    div[x-foo] {\r\n\t      font-weight: bold;\r\n\t    }\r\n\t\r\n\t  Note that elements that are dynamically added to a scope must have the scope\r\n\t  selector added to them manually.\r\n\t\r\n\t  * upper/lower bound encapsulation: Styles which are defined outside a\r\n\t  shadowRoot should not cross the ShadowDOM boundary and should not apply\r\n\t  inside a shadowRoot.\r\n\t\r\n\t  This styling behavior is not emulated. Some possible ways to do this that\r\n\t  were rejected due to complexity and/or performance concerns include: (1) reset\r\n\t  every possible property for every possible selector for a given scope name;\r\n\t  (2) re-implement css in javascript.\r\n\t\r\n\t  As an alternative, users should make sure to use selectors\r\n\t  specific to the scope in which they are working.\r\n\t\r\n\t  * ::distributed: This behavior is not emulated. It's often not necessary\r\n\t  to style the contents of a specific insertion point and instead, descendants\r\n\t  of the host element can be styled selectively. Users can also create an\r\n\t  extra node around an insertion point and style that node's contents\r\n\t  via descendent selectors. For example, with a shadowRoot like this:\r\n\t\r\n\t    <style>\r\n\t      ::content(div) {\r\n\t        background: red;\r\n\t      }\r\n\t    </style>\r\n\t    <content></content>\r\n\t\r\n\t  could become:\r\n\t\r\n\t    <style>\r\n\t      / *@polyfill .content-container div * /\r\n\t      ::content(div) {\r\n\t        background: red;\r\n\t      }\r\n\t    </style>\r\n\t    <div class=\"content-container\">\r\n\t      <content></content>\r\n\t    </div>\r\n\t\r\n\t  Note the use of @polyfill in the comment above a ShadowDOM specific style\r\n\t  declaration. This is a directive to the styling shim to use the selector\r\n\t  in comments in lieu of the next selector when running under polyfill.\r\n\t*/\r\n\tvar ShadowCss = (function () {\r\n\t    function ShadowCss() {\r\n\t        this.strictStyling = true;\r\n\t    }\r\n\t    /*\r\n\t    * Shim some cssText with the given selector.

When the\n * directive's `selector` matches\n * elements in the DOM, the following steps occur:\n *\n * 1. For each directive, the `ElementInjector` attempts to resolve the directive's constructor\n * arguments.\n * 2. Angular instantiates directives for each matched element using `ElementInjector` in a\n * depth-first order,\n *    as declared in the HTML.\n *\n * ## Understanding How Injection Works\n *\n * There are three stages of injection resolution.\n * - *Pre-existing Injectors*:\n *   - The terminal {@link Injector} cannot resolve dependencies. It either throws an error or, if\n * the dependency was\n *     specified as `@Optional`, returns `null`.\n *   - The platform injector resolves browser singleton resources, such as: cookies, title,\n * location, and others.\n * - *Component Injectors*: Each component instance has its own {@link Injector}, and they follow\n * the same parent-child hierarchy\n *     as the component instances in the DOM.\n * - *Element Injectors*: Each component instance has a Shadow DOM. Within the Shadow DOM each\n * element has an `ElementInjector`\n *     which follow the same parent-child hierarchy as the DOM elements themselves.\n *\n * When a template is instantiated, it also must instantiate the corresponding directives in a\n * depth-first order. The\n * current `ElementInjector` resolves the constructor dependencies for each directive.\n *\n * Angular then resolves dependencies as follows, according to the order in which they appear in the\n * {@link ViewMetadata}:\n *\n * 1. Dependencies on the current element\n * 2. Dependencies on element injectors and their parents until it encounters a Shadow DOM boundary\n * 3. Dependencies on component injectors and their parents until it encounters the root component\n * 4. Dependencies on pre-existing injectors\n *\n *\n * The `ElementInjector` can inject other directives, element-specific special objects, or it can\n * delegate to the parent\n * injector.\n *\n * To inject other directives, declare the constructor parameter as:\n * - `directive:DirectiveType`: a directive on the current element only\n * - `@Host() directive:DirectiveType`: any directive that matches the type between the current\n * element and the\n *    Shadow DOM root.\n * - `@Query(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of direct child\n * directives.\n * - `@QueryDescendants(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of any\n * child directives.\n *\n * To inject element-specific special objects, declare the constructor parameter as:\n * - `element: ElementRef` to obtain a reference to logical element in the view.\n * - `viewContainer: ViewContainerRef` to control child template instantiation, for\n * {@link DirectiveMetadata} directives only\n * - `bindingPropagation: BindingPropagation` to control change detection in a more granular way.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * The following example demonstrates how dependency injection resolves constructor arguments in\n * practice.\n *\n *\n * Assume this HTML template:\n *\n * ```\n * <div dependency=\"1\">\n *   <div dependency=\"2\">\n *     <div dependency=\"3\" my-directive>\n *       <div dependency=\"4\">\n *         <div dependency=\"5\"></div>\n *       </div>\n *       <div dependency=\"6\"></div>\n *     </div>\n *   </div>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * With the following `dependency` decorator and `SomeService` injectable class.\n *\n * ```\n * @Injectable()\n * class SomeService {\n * }\n *\n * @Directive({\n *   selector: '[dependency]',\n *   inputs: [\n *     'id: dependency'\n *   ]\n * })\n * class Dependency {\n *   id:string;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Let's step through the different ways in which `MyDirective` could be declared...\n *\n *\n * ### No injection\n *\n * Here the constructor is declared with no arguments, therefore nothing is injected into\n * `MyDirective`.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor() {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with no dependencies.\n *\n *\n * ### Component-level injection\n *\n * Directives can inject any injectable instance from the closest component injector or any of its\n * parents.\n *\n * Here, the constructor declares a parameter, `someService`, and injects the `SomeService` type\n * from the parent\n * component's injector.\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(someService: SomeService) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a dependency on `SomeService`.\n *\n *\n * ### Injecting a directive from the current element\n *\n * Directives can inject other directives declared on the current element.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(dependency: Dependency) {\n *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(3);\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n * This directive would be instantiated with `Dependency` declared at the same element, in this case\n * `dependency=\"3\"`.\n *\n * ### Injecting a directive from any ancestor elements\n *\n * Directives can inject other directives declared on any ancestor element (in the current Shadow\n * DOM), i.e. on the current element, the\n * parent element, or its parents.\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Host() dependency: Dependency) {\n *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(2);\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * `@Host` checks the current element, the parent, as well as its parents recursively. If\n * `dependency=\"2\"` didn't\n * exist on the direct parent, this injection would\n * have returned\n * `dependency=\"1\"`.\n *\n *\n * ### Injecting a live collection of direct child directives\n *\n *\n * A directive can also query for other child directives. Since parent directives are instantiated\n * before child directives, a directive can't simply inject the list of child directives. Instead,\n * the directive injects a {@link QueryList}, which updates its contents as children are added,\n * removed, or moved by a directive that uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} such as a `ngFor`, an\n * `ngIf`, or an `ngSwitch`.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Query(Dependency) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a {@link QueryList} which contains `Dependency` 4 and\n * `Dependency` 6. Here, `Dependency` 5 would not be included, because it is not a direct child.\n *\n * ### Injecting a live collection of descendant directives\n *\n * By passing the descendant flag to `@Query` above, we can include the children of the child\n * elements.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Query(Dependency, {descendants: true}) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a Query which would contain `Dependency` 4, 5 and 6.\n *\n * ### Optional injection\n *\n * The normal behavior of directives is to return an error when a specified dependency cannot be\n * resolved. If you\n * would like to inject `null` on unresolved dependency instead, you can annotate that dependency\n * with `@Optional()`.\n * This explicitly permits the author of a template to treat some of the surrounding directives as\n * optional.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Optional() dependency:Dependency) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a `Dependency` directive found on the current element.\n * If none can be\n * found, the injector supplies `null` instead of throwing an error.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * Here we use a decorator directive to simply define basic tool-tip behavior.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({\n *   selector: '[tooltip]',\n *   inputs: [\n *     'text: tooltip'\n *   ],\n *   host: {\n *     '(mouseenter)': 'onMouseEnter()',\n *     '(mouseleave)': 'onMouseLeave()'\n *   }\n * })\n * class Tooltip{\n *   text:string;\n *   overlay:Overlay; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\n *   overlayManager:OverlayManager; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\n *\n *   constructor(overlayManager:OverlayManager) {\n *     this.overlay = overlay;\n *   }\n *\n *   onMouseEnter() {\n *     // exact signature to be determined\n *     this.overlay = this.overlayManager.open(text, ...);\n *   }\n *\n *   onMouseLeave() {\n *     this.overlay.close();\n *     this.overlay = null;\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n * In our HTML template, we can then add this behavior to a `<div>` or any other element with the\n * `tooltip` selector,\n * like so:\n *\n * ```\n * <div tooltip=\"some text here\"></div>\n * ```\n *\n * Directives can also control the instantiation, destruction, and positioning of inline template\n * elements:\n *\n * A directive uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} to instantiate, insert, move, and destroy views at\n * runtime.\n * The {@link ViewContainerRef} is created as a result of `<template>` element, and represents a\n * location in the current view\n * where these actions are performed.\n *\n * Views are always created as children of the current {@link ViewMetadata}, and as siblings of the\n * `<template>` element. Thus a\n * directive in a child view cannot inject the directive that created it.\n *\n * Since directives that create views via ViewContainers are common in Angular, and using the full\n * `<template>` element syntax is wordy, Angular\n * also supports a shorthand notation: `<li *foo=\"bar\">` and `<li template=\"foo: bar\">` are\n * equivalent.\n *\n * Thus,\n *\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <li *foo=\"bar\" title=\"text\"></li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Expands in use to:\n *\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <template [foo]=\"bar\">\n *     <li title=\"text\"></li>\n *   </template>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Notice that although the shorthand places `*foo=\"bar\"` within the `<li>` element, the binding for\n * the directive\n * controller is correctly instantiated on the `<template>` element rather than the `<li>` element.\n *\n * ## Lifecycle hooks\n *\n * When the directive class implements some {@link angular2/lifecycle_hooks} the callbacks are\n * called by the change detection at defined points in time during the life of the directive.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * Let's suppose we want to implement the `unless` behavior, to conditionally include a template.\n *\n * Here is a simple directive that triggers on an `unless` selector:\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({\n *   selector: '[unless]',\n *   inputs: ['unless']\n * })\n * export class Unless {\n *   viewContainer: ViewContainerRef;\n *   templateRef: TemplateRef;\n *   prevCondition: boolean;\n *\n *   constructor(viewContainer: ViewContainerRef, templateRef: TemplateRef) {\n *     this.viewContainer = viewContainer;\n *     this.templateRef = templateRef;\n *     this.prevCondition = null;\n *   }\n *\n *   set unless(newCondition) {\n *     if (newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || !this.prevCondition)) {\n *       this.prevCondition = true;\n *       this.viewContainer.clear();\n *     } else if (!newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || this.prevCondition)) {\n *       this.prevCondition = false;\n *       this.viewContainer.create(this.templateRef);\n *     }\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * We can then use this `unless` selector in a template:\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <li *unless=\"expr\"></li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Once the directive instantiates the child view, the shorthand notation for the template expands\n * and the result is:\n *\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <template [unless]=\"exp\">\n *     <li></li>\n *   </template>\n *   <li></li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Note also that although the `<li></li>` template still exists inside the `<template></template>`,\n * the instantiated\n * view occurs on the second `<li></li>` which is a sibling to the `<template>` element.\n */\n@CONST()\nexport class DirectiveMetadata extends

It is copied from DirectiveMetadata.\n/**\n * Directives allow you to attach behavior to elements in the DOM.\n *\n * {@link DirectiveMetadata}s with an embedded view are called {@link ComponentMetadata}s.\n *\n * A directive consists of a single directive annotation and a controller class. When the\n * directive's `selector` matches\n * elements in the DOM, the following steps occur:\n *\n * 1. For each directive, the `ElementInjector` attempts to resolve the directive's constructor\n * arguments.\n * 2. Angular instantiates directives for each matched element using `ElementInjector` in a\n * depth-first order,\n *    as declared in the HTML.\n *\n * ## Understanding How Injection Works\n *\n * There are three stages of injection resolution.\n * - *Pre-existing Injectors*:\n *   - The terminal {@link Injector} cannot resolve dependencies. It either throws an error or, if\n * the dependency was\n *     specified as `@Optional`, returns `null`.\n *   - The platform injector resolves browser singleton resources, such as: cookies, title,\n * location, and others.\n * - *Component Injectors*: Each component instance has its own {@link Injector}, and they follow\n * the same parent-child hierarchy\n *     as the component instances in the DOM.\n * - *Element Injectors*: Each component instance has a Shadow DOM. Within the Shadow DOM each\n * element has an `ElementInjector`\n *     which follow the same parent-child hierarchy as the DOM elements themselves.\n *\n * When a template is instantiated, it also must instantiate the corresponding directives in a\n * depth-first order. The\n * current `ElementInjector` resolves the constructor dependencies for each directive.\n *\n * Angular then resolves dependencies as follows, according to the order in which they appear in the\n * {@link ViewMetadata}:\n *\n * 1. Dependencies on the current element\n * 2. Dependencies on element injectors and their parents until it encounters a Shadow DOM boundary\n * 3. Dependencies on component injectors and their parents until it encounters the root component\n * 4. Dependencies on pre-existing injectors\n *\n *\n * The `ElementInjector` can inject other directives, element-specific special objects, or it can\n * delegate to the parent\n * injector.\n *\n * To inject other directives, declare the constructor parameter as:\n * - `directive:DirectiveType`: a directive on the current element only\n * - `@Host() directive:DirectiveType`: any directive that matches the type between the current\n * element and the\n *    Shadow DOM root.\n * - `@Query(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of direct child\n * directives.\n * - `@QueryDescendants(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of any\n * child directives.\n *\n * To inject element-specific special objects, declare the constructor parameter as:\n * - `element: ElementRef` to obtain a reference to logical element in the view.\n * - `viewContainer: ViewContainerRef` to control child template instantiation, for\n * {@link DirectiveMetadata} directives only\n * - `bindingPropagation: BindingPropagation` to control change detection in a more granular way.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * The following example demonstrates how dependency injection resolves constructor arguments in\n * practice.\n *\n *\n * Assume this HTML template:\n *\n * ```\n * <div dependency=\"1\">\n *   <div dependency=\"2\">\n *     <div dependency=\"3\" my-directive>\n *       <div dependency=\"4\">\n *         <div dependency=\"5\"></div>\n *       </div>\n *       <div dependency=\"6\"></div>\n *     </div>\n *   </div>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * With the following `dependency` decorator and `SomeService` injectable class.\n *\n * ```\n * @Injectable()\n * class SomeService {\n * }\n *\n * @Directive({\n *   selector: '[dependency]',\n *   inputs: [\n *     'id: dependency'\n *   ]\n * })\n * class Dependency {\n *   id:string;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Let's step through the different ways in which `MyDirective` could be declared...\n *\n *\n * ### No injection\n *\n * Here the constructor is declared with no arguments, therefore nothing is injected into\n * `MyDirective`.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor() {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with no dependencies.\n *\n *\n * ### Component-level injection\n *\n * Directives can inject any injectable instance from the closest component injector or any of its\n * parents.\n *\n * Here, the constructor declares a parameter, `someService`, and injects the `SomeService` type\n * from the parent\n * component's injector.\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(someService: SomeService) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a dependency on `SomeService`.\n *\n *\n * ### Injecting a directive from the current element\n *\n * Directives can inject other directives declared on the current element.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(dependency: Dependency) {\n *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(3);\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n * This directive would be instantiated with `Dependency` declared at the same element, in this case\n * `dependency=\"3\"`.\n *\n * ### Injecting a directive from any ancestor elements\n *\n * Directives can inject other directives declared on any ancestor element (in the current Shadow\n * DOM), i.e. on the current element, the\n * parent element, or its parents.\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Host() dependency: Dependency) {\n *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(2);\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * `@Host` checks the current element, the parent, as well as its parents recursively. If\n * `dependency=\"2\"` didn't\n * exist on the direct parent, this injection would\n * have returned\n * `dependency=\"1\"`.\n *\n *\n * ### Injecting a live collection of direct child directives\n *\n *\n * A directive can also query for other child directives. Since parent directives are instantiated\n * before child directives, a directive can't simply inject the list of child directives. Instead,\n * the directive injects a {@link QueryList}, which updates its contents as children are added,\n * removed, or moved by a directive that uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} such as a `ngFor`, an\n * `ngIf`, or an `ngSwitch`.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Query(Dependency) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a {@link QueryList} which contains `Dependency` 4 and\n * 6. Here, `Dependency` 5 would not be included, because it is not a direct child.\n *\n * ### Injecting a live collection of descendant directives\n *\n * By passing the descendant flag to `@Query` above, we can include the children of the child\n * elements.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Query(Dependency, {descendants: true}) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a Query which would contain `Dependency` 4, 5 and 6.\n *\n * ### Optional injection\n *\n * The normal behavior of directives is to return an error when a specified dependency cannot be\n * resolved. If you\n * would like to inject `null` on unresolved dependency instead, you can annotate that dependency\n * with `@Optional()`.\n * This explicitly permits the author of a template to treat some of the surrounding directives as\n * optional.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Optional() dependency:Dependency) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a `Dependency` directive found on the current element.\n * If none can be\n * found, the injector supplies `null` instead of throwing an error.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * Here we use a decorator directive to simply define basic tool-tip behavior.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({\n *   selector: '[tooltip]',\n *   inputs: [\n *     'text: tooltip'\n *   ],\n *   host: {\n *     '(mouseenter)': 'onMouseEnter()',\n *     '(mouseleave)': 'onMouseLeave()'\n *   }\n * })\n * class Tooltip{\n *   text:string;\n *   overlay:Overlay; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\n *   overlayManager:OverlayManager; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\n *\n *   constructor(overlayManager:OverlayManager) {\n *     this.overlay = overlay;\n *   }\n *\n *   onMouseEnter() {\n *     // exact signature to be determined\n *     this.overlay = this.overlayManager.open(text, ...);\n *   }\n *\n *   onMouseLeave() {\n *     this.overlay.close();\n *     this.overlay = null;\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n * In our HTML template, we can then add this behavior to a `<div>` or any other element with the\n * `tooltip` selector,\n * like so:\n *\n * ```\n * <div tooltip=\"some text here\"></div>\n * ```\n *\n * Directives can also control the instantiation, destruction, and positioning of inline template\n * elements:\n *\n * A directive uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} to instantiate, insert, move, and destroy views at\n * runtime.\n * The {@link ViewContainerRef} is created as a result of `<template>` element, and represents a\n * location in the current view\n * where these actions are performed.\n *\n * Views are always created as children of the current {@link ViewMetadata}, and as siblings of the\n * `<template>` element. Thus a\n * directive in a child view cannot inject the directive that created it.\n *\n * Since directives that create views via ViewContainers are common in Angular, and using the full\n * `<template>` element syntax is wordy, Angular\n * also supports a shorthand notation: `<li *foo=\"bar\">` and `<li template=\"foo: bar\">` are\n * equivalent.\n *\n * Thus,\n *\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <li *foo=\"bar\" title=\"text\"></li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Expands in use to:\n *\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <template [foo]=\"bar\">\n *     <li title=\"text\"></li>\n *   </template>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Notice that although the shorthand places `*foo=\"bar\"` within the `<li>` element, the binding for\n * the directive\n * controller is correctly instantiated on the `<template>` element rather than the `<li>` element.\n *\n * ## Lifecycle hooks\n *\n * When the directive class implements some {@link angular2/lifecycle_hooks} the callbacks are\n * called by the change detection at defined points in time during the life of the directive.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * Let's suppose we want to implement the `unless` behavior, to conditionally include a template.\n *\n * Here is a simple directive that triggers on an `unless` selector:\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({\n *   selector: '[unless]',\n *   inputs: ['unless']\n * })\n * export class Unless {\n *   viewContainer: ViewContainerRef;\n *   templateRef: TemplateRef;\n *   prevCondition: boolean;\n *\n *   constructor(viewContainer: ViewContainerRef, templateRef: TemplateRef) {\n *     this.viewContainer = viewContainer;\n *     this.templateRef = templateRef;\n *     this.prevCondition = null;\n *   }\n *\n *   set unless(newCondition) {\n *     if (newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || !this.prevCondition)) {\n *       this.prevCondition = true;\n *       this.viewContainer.clear();\n *     } else if (!newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || this.prevCondition)) {\n *       this.prevCondition = false;\n *       this.viewContainer.create(this.templateRef);\n *     }\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * We can then use this `unless` selector in a template:\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <li *unless=\"expr\"></li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Once the directive instantiates the child view, the shorthand notation for the template expands\n * and the result is:\n *\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <template [unless]=\"exp\">\n *     <li></li>\n *   </template>\n *   <li></li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Note also that although the `<li></li>` template still exists inside the `<template></template>`,\n * the instantiated\n * view occurs on the second `<li></li>` which is a sibling to the `<template>` element.\n */\nexport var Directive: DirectiveFactory = <DirectiveFactory>makeDecorator(DirectiveMetadata);\n\n// TODO(alexeagle): remove the duplication of this doc.

This is\n * mainly for security reasons, as well as architectural changes in Angular 2. This means\n * that `index.html` can safely be processed using server-side technologies such as\n * providers. Bindings can thus use double-curly `{{ syntax }}` without collision from\n * Angular 2 component double-curly `{{ syntax }}`.\n *\n * We can use this script code:\n *\n * {@example core/ts/bootstrap/bootstrap.ts region='bootstrap'}\n *\n * When the app developer invokes `bootstrap()` with the root component `MyApp` as its\n * argument, Angular performs the following tasks:\n *\n *  1. It uses the component's `selector` property to locate the DOM element which needs\n *     to be upgraded into the angular component.\n *  2. It creates a new child injector (from the platform injector). Optionally, you can\n *     also override the injector configuration for an app by invoking `bootstrap` with the\n *     `componentInjectableBindings` argument.\n *  3. It creates a new `Zone` and connects it to the angular application's change detection\n *     domain instance.\n *  4. It creates an emulated or shadow DOM on the selected component's host element and loads the\n *     template into it.\n *  5. It instantiates the specified component.\n *  6. Finally, Angular performs change detection to apply the initial data providers for the\n *     application.\n *\n *\n * ## Bootstrapping Multiple Applications\n *\n * When working within a browser window, there are many singleton resources: cookies, title,\n * location, and others. Angular services that represent these resources must likewise be\n * shared across all Angular applications that occupy the same browser window. For this\n * reason, Angular creates exactly one global platform object which stores all shared\n * services, and each angular application injector has the platform injector as its parent.\n *\n * Each application has its own private injector as well. When there are multiple\n * applications on a page, Angular treats each application injector's services as private\n * to that application.\n *\n * ## API\n *\n * - `appComponentType`: The root component which should act as the application. This is\n *   a reference to a `Type` which is annotated with `@Component(...)`.\n * - `customProviders`: An additional set of providers that can be added to the\n *   app injector to override default injection behavior.\n *\n * Returns a `Promise` of {@link ComponentRef}.\n */\nexport function bootstrap(\n    appComponentType: Type,\n    customProviders?: Array<any /*Type | Provider | any[]*/>): Promise<ComponentRef> {\n  reflector.reflectionCapabilities = new ReflectionCapabilities();\n  let appProviders =\n      isPresent(customProviders) ?

The goal is to allow users to avoid the\n  most obvious pitfalls and do so without compromising performance significantly.\n  For ShadowDOM styling that's not covered here, a set of best practices\n  can be provided that should allow users to accomplish more complex styling.\n\n  The following is a list of specific ShadowDOM styling features and a brief\n  discussion of the approach used to shim.\n\n  Shimmed features:\n\n  * :host, :host-context: ShadowDOM allows styling of the shadowRoot's host\n  element using the :host rule. To shim this feature, the :host styles are\n  reformatted and prefixed with a given scope name and promoted to a\n  document level stylesheet.\n  For example, given a scope name of .foo, a rule like this:\n\n    :host {\n        background: red;\n      }\n    }\n\n  becomes:\n\n    .foo {\n      background: red;\n    }\n\n  * encapsultion: Styles defined within ShadowDOM, apply only to\n  dom inside the ShadowDOM. Polymer uses one of two techniques to implement\n  this feature.\n\n  By default, rules are prefixed with the host element tag name\n  as a descendant selector. This ensures styling does not leak out of the 'top'\n  of the element's ShadowDOM. For example,\n\n  div {\n      font-weight: bold;\n    }\n\n  becomes:\n\n  x-foo div {\n      font-weight: bold;\n    }\n\n  becomes:\n\n\n  Alternatively, if WebComponents.ShadowCSS.strictStyling is set to true then\n  selectors are scoped by adding an attribute selector suffix to each\n  simple selector that contains the host element tag name. Each element\n  in the element's ShadowDOM template is also given the scope attribute.\n  Thus, these rules match only elements that have the scope attribute.\n  For example, given a scope name of x-foo, a rule like this:\n\n    div {\n      font-weight: bold;\n    }\n\n  becomes:\n\n    div[x-foo] {\n      font-weight: bold;\n    }\n\n  Note that elements that are dynamically added to a scope must have the scope\n  selector added to them manually.\n\n  * upper/lower bound encapsulation: Styles which are defined outside a\n  shadowRoot should not cross the ShadowDOM boundary and should not apply\n  inside a shadowRoot.\n\n  This styling behavior is not emulated. Some possible ways to do this that\n  were rejected due to complexity and/or performance concerns include: (1) reset\n  every possible property for every possible selector for a given scope name;\n  (2) re-implement css in javascript.\n\n  As an alternative, users should make sure to use selectors\n  specific to the scope in which they are working.\n\n  * ::distributed: This behavior is not emulated. It's often not necessary\n  to style the contents of a specific insertion point and instead, descendants\n  of the host element can be styled selectively. Users can also create an\n  extra node around an insertion point and style that node's contents\n  via descendent selectors. For example, with a shadowRoot like this:\n\n    <style>\n      ::content(div) {\n        background: red;\n      }\n    </style>\n    <content></content>\n\n  could become:\n\n    <style>\n      / *@polyfill .content-container div * /\n      ::content(div) {\n        background: red;\n      }\n    </style>\n    <div class=\"content-container\">\n      <content></content>\n    </div>\n\n  Note the use of @polyfill in the comment above a ShadowDOM specific style\n  declaration. This is a directive to the styling shim to use the selector\n  in comments in lieu of the next selector when running under polyfill.\n*/\n\nexport class ShadowCss {\n  strictStyling: boolean = true;\n\n  constructor() {}\n\n  /*\n  * Shim some cssText with the given selector.
